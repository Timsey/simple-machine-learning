# Environments
This directory contains implementations of simple environments for reinforcement learning.

## List of implementations
- base_environment.py: base environment containing shared methods for all environments.
- cartpole.py: CartPole environment (inverted rigid rod / physical pendulum on cart).
- cartpole_physics.pdf: derivation of CartPole environment physics.
- frozenlake.py: FrozenLake environment (4x4 grid with holes).
- TODO: add slipperyness to FrozenLake.
- TODO: add environment that requires explicit function approximation (using policy gradients).
