# Machine learning in numpy
This directory contains implementations of machine learning algorithms in numpy.

## List of implementations
- vanilla_nn.py: feedforward neural net. Architecture can be set, but only uses fully-connected layers.
- expectation_maximisation.py: EM algorithm implementation on univariate Gaussian data.
- k_means.py: K-means algorithm implementation on multivariate Gaussian data.
- utils.py: contains some utility functions.
- TODO: improve documentation.
- TODO: add functionality for different datasets.
- TODO: add Autoencoder (variational?) CNN and RNN in numpy.
