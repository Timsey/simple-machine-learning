# Machine learning in numpy
This directory contains implementations of machine learning algorithms in numpy.

## List of implementations
- vanilla_nn.py: simple feedforward neural net. Architecture can be set, but only uses fully-connected layers.
- TODO: improve documentation.
- TODO: add functionality for different datasets.
- TODO: add CNN and RNN in numpy.
